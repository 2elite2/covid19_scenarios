## Smart formulas

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.
$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

<div className="text-left">

$$
\frac{dS_{a}(t)}{dt} = - \beta_a(t) S_a(t)\sum_{b}I_b(t)
$$

$$
\frac{dE_{a}(t)}{dt} = \beta_a(t) S_a(t)\sum_{b}I_b(t) - E_{a}(t)/t_l
$$

$$
\frac{dI_{a}(t)}{dt} = E_{a}(t)/t_l - I_a(t)/t_i
$$

$$
\frac{dH_{a}(t)}{dt} = (1-m_a) I_a(t)/t_i + (1-f_a) C_a(t)/t_c - H_a(t)/t_h
$$

$$
\frac{dC_{a}(t)}{dt} = c_a H_a(t)/t_h - C_a(t)/t_c
$$

$$
\frac{dR_{a}(t)}{dt} = m_a I_a(t)/t_i + (1-c_a)H_a(t)
$$

$$
\frac{dD_{a}(t)}{dt} = f_a C_a(t)/t_c

# About COVID-19 Scenarios

This web application serves as a plannling tool for COVID-19 outbreaks in communities across the world.
It implements a simple SIR model with additional categories for exposed individuals that are not yet infectious,
severely sick people in need of hospitalization, people in critical condition, and a fatal category.


The source code of this tool is freely available at <LinkExternal url="https://github.com/neherlab/covid19_scenarios"> github.com/neherlab/covid19_scenarios</LinkExternal> and we welcome contributions in any form: comments, suggestions, help with development.

## Basic assumptions

The model works as follows:

 - susceptible individuals are exposed/infected through contact with infectious individuals. Each infectious
individual causes on average R_<sub>0</sub> secondary infections while they are infectious.
Transmissibility of the virus could have seasonal variation which is parameterized with the parameter
"seasonal forcing" (amplitude) and "peak month" (month of most efficient transmission).

 - exposed individuals progress to a symptomatic/infectious state after an average latency

 - infectious individuals recover or progress to severe disease. The ratio of recovery to severe progression
depends on age

 - severely sick individuals either recover or deteriorate and turn critical. Again, this depends on the age

 - critically ill individuals either return to regular hospital or die. Again, this depends on the age


The individual parameters of the model can all be changed to allow exploration of different scenarios.

    E is 'exposed', I is 'infectious', R 'recovered', H 'severe' (hospitalized), C 'critical' (ICU), and D are
    fatalities.

COVID-19 is much more severe in the elderly and proportion of elderly in a community is therefore an important determinant of the overall burden on the health care system and the death toll. We collected age distributions for many countries from data provided by the UN and make those available as input parameters. Furthermore, we use data provided by the epidemiology group by the <LinkExternal url="http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51">Chinese CDC</LinkExternal> to estimate the fraction of severe and fatal cases by age group.


## Seasonality

Many respiratory viruses such as influenza, common cold viruses (including other coronaviruses) have a pronounced seasonal variation in incidence which is in part driven by climate variation through the year. We model this seasonal variation using a cosine with an annual period. This is simplistic way to capture seasonality and we don't know yet how seasonality will affect COVID-19 transmission.

  <figcaption className="figure-caption text-center">
    Figure 2. Seasonal variation in transmission rate is modeled by a cosine. The model allows to specify the
    average R0, the amplitude of the cosine (seasonal forcing), and the month of peak transmission.

## Transmission reduction

The tool allows to explore temporal variation in the reduction of transmission by infection control measures.
This is implemented as a curve through time that can be dragged by the mouse to modifiy the assumed
transmission. The curve is read out and used to change transmission relative to the base line parameters for
R0 and seasonality.
